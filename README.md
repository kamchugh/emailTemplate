# emailTemplate
A program to easily create weekly emails for subscription based companies. This project utilizes Javascript, handlebars, html, CSS, and a little bit of jQuery.
Before I knew how to code, I spent hours trying to create emails that were essentially the same aside from the product offering. This project would allow anyone who doesn't know how to code to easily create custom emails for their subscription company.
